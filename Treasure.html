                            <p>My contribution to the Candev2020 Data Challenge introduced me to processing and cleaning data using the pandas library and visualizing the data using tableau. The main goal of the project was to build a better way to explore and understand how programs related to business innovation and growth support change over time. The given data sets were handed to us by two data scientist managers who work at the Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat.</p>
                            <p>By the end of the challenge we were able to draw some key insights on how different departments allocate their funding to different businesses across Canada over time. We were able to draw some key relationships on the effect that has had based on key activites and movements happening in different job sectors. My team and I took decided to take it one step forward by contextualizing the data and relating it to the population and money generated in each province. As a result we were able to show how effeciently each province was able to spend their funds and where each deparment should focus on releasing funds in the future.</p>
